Galleria is a lightweight photo gallery application written in Python. The main ideas behind it are:

1. No administrative interface, everything is managed via image files.
2. Photos are grouped in bundles (galleries).
3. Photos can be filtered by many criteria (tags, authors, shooting dates), also across bundles.
4. Each bundle can contain hundreds of photos.
5. Front-end is responsive and mobile device friendly.
6. Friendly URLs for easy blogging.
7. Anonymous access can be restricted.
